### Deployment Journey

#### Phase 1: v4 Migration Attempt (func-cocktaildb2 - Flex Consumption)

- Attempted to migrate to Azure Functions v4 SDK for Flex Consumption plan
- Resolved initial issues:
  - Fixed GitHub Actions to deploy correct folder
  - Implemented lazy initialization for services using Key Vault references
  - Fixed import paths and removed v3 artifacts
- Result: Functions briefly worked but subsequent deployments failed with "0 functions loaded"

#### Phase 2: Revert to Windows Consumption (func-mba-fresh)

- Created new Windows Consumption plan function app
- Discovered that Windows Consumption with runtime v4 requires v3 SDK patterns
- Key fixes:
  - Each function needs `function.json` with bindings
  - Use `module.exports = async function(context, req)` pattern
  - Output binding name must match code usage (res vs $return)

#### Phase 3: Azure OpenAI Migration (2025-10-31)

- **Problem**: Azure OpenAI service was in East US while all other resources were in South Central US
- **Solution**: Created new Azure OpenAI service in South Central US for better co-location
- **Actions taken**:
  1. Created `mybartenderai-scus` Azure OpenAI service in South Central US
  2. Deployed gpt-4o-mini model with 100 TPM capacity
  3. Created new Key Vault secret: `AZURE-OPENAI-API-KEY`
  4. Updated Key Vault secret: `AZURE-OPENAI-ENDPOINT` to point to new service
  5. Granted Function App Managed Identity "Key Vault Secrets User" role via RBAC
  6. Fixed OpenAI Node.js SDK configuration for Azure OpenAI compatibility
  7. Updated `ask-bartender-simple` endpoint with proper Azure OpenAI configuration
  8. Updated mobile app to use `/api/v1/ask-bartender-simple` endpoint
  9. Deleted old East US OpenAI service
- **Key Fix**: The issue was with OpenAI SDK configuration - needed to set:
  - `baseURL`: `${endpoint}/openai/deployments/${deployment}`
  - `defaultQuery`: `{ 'api-version': '2024-10-21' }`
  - `defaultHeaders`: `{ 'api-key': apiKey }`
- **Result**: AI Bartender chat now fully operational with Azure OpenAI in South Central US

### Key Learnings

1. **Azure Functions Runtime vs SDK Versions**:
   
   - Runtime v4 (`FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION=~4`) can run both v3 and v4 SDK code
   - Windows Consumption plans work best with v3 SDK patterns
   - Linux Flex Consumption plans require v4 SDK patterns

2. **v3 SDK Pattern Requirements**:
   
   - Each function needs a `function.json` file with bindings
   - Function code uses `module.exports = async function(context, req)`
   - Response is set via `context.res = { status, body }`
   - Output binding name in function.json must match code (e.g., "res" not "$return")

3. **Deployment Best Practices**:
   
   - Use `az functionapp deployment source config-zip` for reliable deployments
   - Avoid "dirty deployment" issues from residual files
   - Test functions work locally before deploying

### Next Steps

1. **Convert remaining functions to v3 pattern**:
   
   - [ ] recommend function
   - [ ] sync-cocktaildb function  
   - [ ] download-images function

2. **Test complete API functionality**:
   
   - [ ] Test JWT authentication on recommend endpoint
   - [ ] Verify timer trigger for sync-cocktaildb
   - [ ] Test image download capabilities

3. **Production readiness**:
   
   - [ ] Set up proper CI/CD pipeline
   - [ ] Configure monitoring and alerts
   - [ ] Document API endpoints for mobile team
