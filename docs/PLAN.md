# PLAN â€” Acceptance Criteria & Test Ideas

API Layer: Azure API Management (APIM) gateway to Azure Functions (HTTP triggers)
Gateway: `apim-mba-001` (Developer tier for MVP, Consumption tier for production)
Base URL:

- Local: http://localhost:7073
- Dev/Prod: https://apim-mba-001.azure-api.net

Security & AuthN/AuthZ

- JWT validation via Microsoft Entra External ID at APIM layer
- APIM subscription keys (API keys) per mobile app installation
- Claims-based authZ per feature/endpoint
- Tier-based access control via APIM Products (Free/Premium/Pro)

Rate limiting & Abuse Mitigation

- APIM policies for rate limiting per product/subscription
- Per-IP rate limiting at APIM edge
- Backend PostgreSQL counters for feature quota tracking (AI calls, voice minutes)
- Optional Azure Front Door WAF if needed post-MVP
- Structured logging in Functions with PII redaction before emit

Observability

- Application Insights (Functions + APIM) with custom events
- APIM Analytics for API usage per tier
- Correlation IDs propagated from mobile client headers
- Voice usage tracking (minutes per user/tier)

Deployment

- APIM manually configured via Azure Portal (Developer tier)
- CI/CD deploys Function App
- OpenAPI remains single source of truth for contracts
- APIM imports OpenAPI spec for automatic endpoint configuration

## Feature: Inventory â†’ Recommendations (MVP)

- Given on-device inventory exists, when user taps "Get ideas", app returns â‰¥3 recommendations within p95 600ms (cache hit).
- APIM validates subscription tier before forwarding to backend
- 4xx/5xx paths show standard error shape and retry CTA.
- Offline: show local-only suggestions from SQLite.
- Tests:
  - Contract tests: recommend request/response matches `/spec`
  - Mobile: golden tests for cards; integration test that injects fake repo returns fixed list
  - APIM: Verify rate limiting policies per tier

### Cost & Caching Acceptance

- Given an identical system prompt + schema hash, when 20 consecutive premium requests run within 5 minutes,
  server metrics show â‰¥40% reduction in OpenAI input cost vs. uncached baseline (sample window).
- Server logs include `cacheKeyHash`, `cacheHit:boolean` per call (PII-free).
- Quota tests: when a user exceeds server-side monthly token allotment, Functions returns 429 with standard Error schema.
- APIM enforces daily/monthly rate limits at API gateway layer

### Voice Assistant Feature (Premium/Pro)

**Architecture: Azure Speech Services + GPT-4o-mini**

- Mobile client uses Azure Speech SDK for Speech-to-Text (local processing)
- Text query sent via APIM to `POST /v1/ask-bartender`
- GPT-4o-mini processes query and returns conversational text response
- Mobile client uses Azure Speech SDK for Text-to-Speech (local playback)
- No OpenAI Realtime API (cost prohibitive)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AC1: `GET /v1/speech/token` returns valid 10-minute Azure Speech token (Premium/Pro only)
- AC2: End-to-end voice session latency < 2 seconds p95 (STT â†’ API â†’ TTS start)
- AC3: Voice sessions tracked in PostgreSQL; enforces tier limits:
  - Premium: 30 minutes/month
  - Pro: 5 hours/month
- AC4: When voice quota exceeded, 429 response with upgrade CTA
- AC5: Speech recognition accuracy > 95% with bartending vocabulary
- AC6: GPT-4o-mini responses optimized for voice (conversational, < 100 words)
- AC7: All voice transcripts ephemeral unless user opts in to save
- AC8: APIM rate limits for speech token endpoint: 60 calls/hour

**Test Ideas:**

- Unit: GPT-4o-mini prompt quality for voice instructions
- Integration: Full voice flow (mock STT/TTS, real API calls)
- Performance: Measure latency at each step (STT, API, TTS)
- Cost: Verify session cost < $0.12 per 5-minute interaction
- UX: Test interruption handling, background noise tolerance
- Security: Verify tokens expire, no API keys exposed to client

### CocktailDB Mirror & JSON Snapshot

**Status:** âœ… **OPERATIONAL** (as of 2025-10-23)

**Acceptance criteria**

- âœ… AC1: Nightly timer run produces a new snapshot when upstream data changed; otherwise reuses last `snapshotVersion`.
  - Timer: Daily at 03:30 UTC
  - Current version: 20251023.033020 (71KB compressed)
  - Sync duration: ~16 seconds
- âœ… AC2: `GET /v1/snapshots/latest` returns 200 with valid `signedUrl` (SAS â‰¤ 15 min expiry) and correct `sha256`.
  - Direct endpoint: https://func-mba-fresh.azurewebsites.net/api/v1/snapshots/latest
  - APIM endpoint: TBD (will enforce tier access when APIM configured)
  - Response includes: schemaVersion, snapshotVersion, sizeBytes, sha256, signedUrl, createdAtUtc, counts
  - Rate limiting: TBD (via APIM policies)
- ðŸ“‹ AC3: A clean mobile install downloads snapshot, verifies `sha256`, stores DB to app documents, and queries locally with <100ms p95 for lookups.
  - Mobile app integration pending
- âœ… AC4: Sync handles partial upstream failures with retry/backoff and leaves last good snapshot intact.
  - Sync implemented with error handling
  - Last good snapshot preserved on failure
- âœ… AC5: Logs contain `runId`, counts, and durations; **no secrets or PII**.
  - Application Insights configured
  - Structured logging in place
- AC6: Manual `POST /v1/admin/sync` (with function key, bypasses APIM) enqueues/starts a run and returns 202.

**Test ideas**

- Unit: upsert mappers (CDB â†’ PG rows), idempotent measures join, tag parsing, ETag handling.
- Integration: run sync against a recorded fixture; verify PG counts and a generated JSON's structure.
- Contract: `SnapshotInfo` schema; NDJSON change feed framing.
- Perf: Snapshot build â‰¤ 3 min; mobile cold start download â‰¤ 10s on 10 Mbps.
- Chaos: simulate CDB 429/5xx; ensure exponential backoff with jitter; run resumes next cycle.
- APIM: Test rate limiting on snapshot endpoint

## APIM Configuration & Testing

### Products (Subscription Tiers)

**Free Tier:**

- Rate limit: 100 API calls/day
- Features: Snapshot downloads only
- No AI features (blocked at APIM)

**Premium Tier ($4.99/month):**

### Acceptance Criteria for APIM

- AC1: Mobile app obtains APIM subscription key during signup
- AC2: All API requests include `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header
- AC3: APIM validates subscription and enforces rate limits before forwarding to Functions
- AC4: Free tier blocked from `/v1/ask-bartender`, `/v1/speech/token`, `/v1/vision/*`
- AC5: Premium/Pro tiers can access all endpoints within quota
- AC6: 429 response when rate limit exceeded with `Retry-After` header
- AC7: APIM logs requests with correlation IDs for debugging
- AC8: Backend Functions do NOT see subscription keys (APIM strips/replaces with internal auth)

### Test Ideas for APIM

- APIM rate limiting enforced per tier.

**Errors**

- 401 without valid JWT (APIM rejects before backend).
- 403 when Free tier tries Premium feature.
- 429 when rate limit exceeded.
- 400 when payload invalid (e.g., missing category/name).

**Tests**

- API contract tests (Dredd/Prism/owasp zap for security).

- APIM tracks usage against user's monthly quota.

**Errors**

- 429 on per-user quota limit (Premium: 100/month).
- 403 when Free tier attempts access.
- 400 when prompt empty.
- 503 when OpenAI service unavailable (APIM retries once).

**Tests**

- JSON schema compliance; max tokens; prompt-injection hardening.
- Latency budget < 2.5s end-to-end for first token.
- Cost tracking: Verify token usage logged correctly.
- Quota enforcement: Test 100th Premium request succeeds, 101st returns 429.

## Feature: Voice Assistant (Azure Speech Services)

**Happy path**

- App obtains Azure Speech token via `GET /v1/speech/token` (APIM validates Premium/Pro tier).

## Feature: Vision Scan (Future)

**Happy path**

- App obtains SAS token via `GET /v1/uploads/images/sas` (Premium/Pro only).
- Upload image to Blob Storage.
- Call `POST /v1/vision/scan-bottle` with blobUrl.
- Poll `GET /v1/vision/scan-bottle?requestId=â€¦` until status=done.
- Returns detected bottles with confidence scores.

**Errors**

- 403 when Free tier attempts access.
- 400 for invalid blob URL or expired SAS.
- 413 for oversized images (>10MB).
- 429 when monthly scan quota exceeded.

## Cost Management
