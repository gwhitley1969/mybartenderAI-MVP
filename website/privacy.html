      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Xtend-AI, LLC</strong> ("Xtend-AI," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our website and the <strong>My AI Bartender</strong> mobile application (collectively, the "Services").</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
      <p><strong>Company:</strong> Xtend-AI, LLC<br>
      <strong>Product:</strong> My AI Bartender<br>
      <strong>Contact email:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@xtend-ai.com">support@xtend-ai.com</a></p>

      <hr>

      <h2>2) What we collect</h2>

      <h3>A. Information you provide</h3>
      <p>Depending on how you use the Services, you may provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account and login info</strong> (for example, email address or social sign-in): Authentication is handled by our identity provider. We do <strong>not</strong> store your password.</li>
        <li><strong>Age verification info:</strong> You will be asked for information to confirm you are of legal drinking age (for example, date of birth).</li>
        <li><strong>Profile info:</strong> Such as display name or a system-generated alias (if enabled).</li>
        <li><strong>User content:</strong> Such as cocktail notes, custom recipes, favorites, bar inventory, and messages you choose to send through social sharing features (if enabled).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B. Photos and camera data (Smart Scanner)</h3>
      <p>If you use Smart Scanner, you provide a <strong>photo</strong> (or camera capture) for ingredient/bottle identification.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The photo is <strong>processed to provide the feature</strong>.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use your photos for advertising.</li>
        <li>Unless explicitly stated in the app at the time of capture, we do <strong>not</strong> retain bar photos after processing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C. Voice and audio data (Voice AI)</h3>
      <p>If you use Voice AI, your device captures audio and connects <strong>directly</strong> to our Voice AI provider using <strong>WebRTC</strong>. Our backend issues an <strong>ephemeral session token</strong> that allows this connection.</p>
      <p>During a voice session:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your <strong>audio</strong> is processed to generate responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Speech-to-text transcription</strong> may be generated (for example, to show you what you said and what the AI said).</li>
        <li>We store <strong>voice usage and session metadata</strong> such as session identifiers, duration (seconds used), and token counts to enforce quotas, prevent abuse, and operate the feature.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Transcripts:</strong> Depending on product settings and the version of the feature, transcripts may be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>shown only in-app during the session and not stored long-term, or</li>
        <li>stored as conversation history associated with your account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If transcripts are stored, they are used to provide and improve the Voice experience for you (for example, showing conversation history and debugging issues).</p>

      <h3>D. Usage, diagnostics, and device information</h3>
      <p>We collect typical technical data needed to run and secure the Services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>App interactions and feature usage (for example, quota usage, session duration)</li>
        <li>Log and diagnostics data (crash reports, performance metrics)</li>
        <li>Device and network information (device type, OS version, approximate location derived from IP, and similar signals)</li>
        <li>Identifiers used for security and fraud prevention</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>E. Subscription and payment information</h3>
      <p>Purchases are processed by <strong>Apple App Store</strong> and/or <strong>Google Play</strong> (and/or our subscription management provider). We generally receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subscription status (active/inactive), product tier, renewal dates</li>
        <li>Transaction identifiers and receipt validation data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We <strong>do not</strong> receive or store your full payment card information.</p>

      <h2>4) How we share information</h2>
      <p>We share information in limited ways:</p>

      <h3>A. Service providers (processors)</h3>
      <p>We use service providers to operate the Services, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud hosting, databases, and monitoring</strong> (to run the app backend and telemetry)</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication/identity</strong> (to let you sign in using email/password or social identity providers)</li>

            <li>Text chat and recommendations (Azure OpenAI)</li>

        </li>

      <h3>B. Legal, safety, and enforcement</h3>

      </ul>

      <h3>C. Business transfers</h3>
      <p>If we're involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>5) Data retention</h2>
      <p>We keep information only as long as necessary to provide the Services, maintain security, enforce quotas, and comply with legal obligations.</p>
      <p>Typical retention patterns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account data:</strong> retained while your account is active.</li>
        <li><strong>Security/diagnostic logs:</strong> retained for a limited period (often 30–180 days), unless we must keep them longer for legal or security reasons.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice usage/session metadata</strong> (e.g., seconds used, session start/end, token counts): retained as needed for quotas, billing-related audits, and abuse prevention.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice transcripts:</strong> may be retained if conversation history is enabled/implemented; otherwise they may be used transiently to display the conversation during the session.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h2>6) Security</h2>
      <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information. No system is 100% secure; you use the Services at your own risk.</p>

      <hr>
